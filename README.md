# helloWorld
A first file for my JavaScript class.

I am James (Jim) Beckley.  I work for Holland America Line as a website QA.  I am taking the JavaScript class through UW extension because we are engaged in attempting to build out a framework for automated testing of the websites.  (We also support Seabourn Cruise Line, a sister brand.)  I need to get up to speed on JavaScript.
